## Unreleased

### Fixed - Statusline shows stale project after resume at umbrella cwd

When a Claude Code session resumed at a parent directory holding multiple project repos (e.g. `~/work`), the SessionStart hook would unconditionally inherit whatever project the previous session at that cwd was bound to. The inherited binding then routed heartbeats to the wrong task, made the statusline display the wrong project name, and survived subsequent `/orbit:go <other-project>` invocations when the slash command's bash step did not fire correctly.

**Root cause:** `_pickup_previous_session_binding` (`hooks/session_start.py`) used the cwd-session pointer match alone as sufficient evidence to inherit. For umbrella cwds, the previous session's specific project is unrelated to the new session's intent.

**Fix:** added a cwd-compatibility gate. The inherited project is now accepted only when the project's repo path is the current cwd or an ancestor of it (i.e. the new session is sitting *inside* the project repo). If the repo lives *under* the cwd or in an unrelated location, the inherit is skipped and the statusline starts blank - the user resolves intent explicitly via `/orbit:go`.

**Conservative on failure:** if orbit-db is unavailable, the task lookup raises, or the task/repo row no longer exists, the inherit proceeds as before. The gate only fires on affirmative evidence that the inherit is wrong.

**Non-coding tasks:** unaffected. Inherit always proceeds for tasks with no `repo_id`.

**New contract for users:** if you have been relying on a parent cwd auto-inheriting the previous session's project, that behavior is gone. Run `/orbit:go <project>` in the new session to bind explicitly, or `cd` into the project's repo before opening Claude Code.
